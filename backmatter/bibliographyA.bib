@article{Qi2008,
abstract = {Despite its great importance, there has been no general consensus on how to model the trends in time-series data. Compared to traditional approaches, neural networks (NNs) have shown some promise in time-series forecasting. This paper investigates how to best model trend time series using NNs. Four different strategies (raw data, raw data with time index, detrending, and differencing) are used to model various trend patterns (linear, nonlinear, deterministic, stochastic, and breaking trend). We find that with NNs differencing often gives meritorious results regardless of the underlying data generating processes (DGPs). This finding is also confirmed by the real gross national product (GNP) series.},

We provide a brief review of the machine learning and regression-based methods used in the analyses of these data. Several regression and machine learning methods were used to address different problems inherent in the analyses of these data, which are high-dimension, low-sample-size data typical of many genetic association studies. Unsupervised methods, such as cluster analysis, were used for data segmentation and, subset selection. Supervised learning methods, which include regression-based methods (e.g., generalized linear models, logic regression, and regularized regression) and tree-based methods (e.g., decision trees and random forests), were used for variable selection (selecting genetic and clinical features most associated or predictive of outcome) and prediction (developing models using common and rare genetic variants to accurately predict outcome), with the outcome being case-control status or quantitative trait value. We include a discussion of cross-validation for model selection and assessment, and a description of available software resources for these methods.},

This paper reports on a related study of radial-basis-function (RBF) networks, and it is proved that RBF networks having one hidden layer are capable of universal approximation. Here the emphasis is on the case of typical RBF networks, and the results show that a certain class of RBF networks with the same smoothing factor in each kernel node is broad enough for universal approximation.},

     abstract = {Regression procedures for parameter estimation in autoregression moving average (ARMA) models are discussed, mainly for providing initial estimates for iterative maximization of a Gaussian likelihood. An iterative procedure of Spliid (1983) is compared to a procedure of Hannan and Rissanen (1982), and a global convergence result is established for an iterative modification of Spliid's procedure. Spliid's iteration does not always converge; when it does, it has the same asymptotic distribution as the second stage of the Hannan-Rissanen procedure. This second-stage iteration gives the same problems as Spliid's procedure, so it is preferable to go immediately to the third stage, which is asymptotically efficient in the Gaussian case. An example is provided by a first-order ARMA model, y(t) + α y(t - 1) = ε (t) + βε (t-1), under the usual regularity conditions of stationarity and invertibility. Spliid's procedure fits an autoregression of predetermined order (i.e., 2) to obtain estimates ε̂<sub>1</sub>(t) of the ε (t), and then regresses y(t) on y(t - 1) and ε̂<sub>1</sub>(t - 1) to obtain estimates α̂<sub>2</sub> and β̂<sub>2</sub>. These estimates are used to filter the data to obtain a further estimate ε̂<sub>2</sub>(t); the procedure is iterated until the sequence of estimates of α and β converges. Convergence will not take place unless <latex>$\alpha\beta < \frac{1}{2}$</latex>. If the order of the autoregression in Spliid's procedure is chosen by the information criterion and only the first regression on y(t - 1) and ε̂<sub>1</sub>(t - 1) is carried out, the first two stages of the Hannan-Rissanen procedure result. Then α̂<sub>2</sub> and β̂<sub>2</sub> converge strongly as T → ∞ to α and β, and they also obey a central limit theorem. The modified Spliid procedure replaces ε̂<sub>(</sub>t) by the residuals from the first regression, and so on. In a restricted sense, this iteration always converges in the ARMA case, and will generally do so if the positive real condition for the moving average transfer function is satisfied [see (1.5) in Sec. 1]. Simulations bear out the theory. In practice, there will be no true ARMA system; in any case, the ARMA orders will need to be determined from the data. Thus the results are of suggestive value only. Nevertheless, these suggestions favor the Hannan-Rissanen procedure.},

@misc{Tumer2003,
abstract = {The Bayes error rate gives a statistical lower bound on the error achievable for a given classification problem and associated choice of features. By reliably estimating this rate, one can assess the usefulness of the feature set that is being used for classification. Moreover, by comparing the accuracy achieved by a given classifier with the Bayes rate, one can quantify how effective that classifier is. Classical approaches for estimating or finding bounds for the Bayes error in general yield rather weak results for small sample sizes, unless the problem has some simple characteristics such as Gaussian class-conditional likelihoods. This article shows how the outputs of a classifier ensemble can be used to provide reliable and easily obtainable estimates of the Bayes error, with negligible extra computation. Three methods of varying so- phistication are described. First, we present a framework that estimates the Bayes error when multiple classifiers, each providing an estimate of the aposteriori class probabilities, are com- bined through averaging. Second, we bolster this approach by adding an information theoretic measure of output correlation to the estimate. Finally, we discuss a more general method that just looks at the class labels indicated by ensemble members and provides error estimates based on the disagreements among classifiers. The methods are illustrated for both artificial data, a difficult four class problem involving underwater acoustic data, and two problems from the Proben1 benchmarks. For data sets with known Bayes error, the combiner based methods in- troduced in this article outperform existing methods. The estimates obtained by the proposed methods also seem quite reliable for the real-life data sets, for which the true Bayes rates are unknown.},

abstract = {In most water-distribution systems, there is water storage, which is operated on a daily cycle to reduce energy charges by shifting pumping away from times of high energy tariffs. The variation in daily water demand depends on temperature, humidity, time since last rainfall, and day of the week. A demand behavioral model is developed, which uses methods of pattern recognition and time-series models. The daily water-demand pattern is described in terms of three states of water use, and low-order auto-regressive integrated moving average models are fitted to each state. The algorithms used in the model are presented and described, and the model is applied to two months of data from the Sorek water system in central Israel.},

Los resultados de este an\'{a}lisis muestran una mejor\'{\i}a significativa en las predicciones; en efecto, el pron\'{o}stico combinado comparado con los pron\'{o}sticos del mejor de los modelos econom\'{e}tricos reporta ganancias en precisi\'{o}n (RMSE); en caso del horizonte de un trimestre es del 16.1\%; para el horizonte de dos trimestres es del 42\%; para el horizonte tres del 21.3\% y del 12.8\% para el horizonte de cuatro trimestres. La segunda aplicaci\'{o}n de las metodolog\'{\i}as de combinaci\'{o}n de pron\'{o}sticos se realiza utilizando un ejercicio de simulaci\'{o}n, el cual se basa en modelos similares a los empleados en el primer ejercicio; los resultados obtenidos muestran que bajo t\'{e}cnicas adecuadas de combinaci\'{o}n de pron\'{o}sticos es posible obtener alrededor de un 50\% y 35\% de ganancia en precisi\'{o}n con respecto a los modelos individuales para horizontes de uno y cuatro trimestres, respectivamente.},

@article{Kantz2004,
abstract = {Legume plants form beneficial symbiotic interactions with nitrogen fixing bacteria (called rhizobia), with the rhizobia being accommodated in unique structures on the roots of the host plant. The legume/rhizobial symbiosis is responsible for a significant proportion of the global biologically available nitrogen. The initiation of this symbiosis is governed by a characteristic calcium oscillation within the plant root hair cells and this signal is activated by the rhizobia. Recent analyses on calcium time series data have suggested that stochastic effects have a large role to play in defining the nature of the oscillations. The use of multiple nonlinear time series techniques, however, suggests an alternative interpretation, namely deterministic chaos. We provide an extensive, nonlinear time series analysis on the nature of this calcium oscillation response. We build up evidence through a series of techniques that test for determinism, quantify linear and nonlinear components, and measure the local divergence of the system. Chaos is common in nature and it seems plausible that properties of chaotic dynamics might be exploited by biological systems to control processes within the cell. Systems possessing chaotic control mechanisms are more robust in the sense that the enhanced flexibility allows more rapid response to environmental changes with less energetic costs. The desired behaviour could be most efficiently targeted in this manner, supporting some intriguing speculations about nonlinear mechanisms in biological signaling.},

Since that time, due in large part to advances in digital computing, the Kalman filter has been the subject of extensive research and application, particularly in the area of autonomous or assisted navigation. The Kalman filter is a set of mathematical equations that provides an efficient computational (recursive) means to estimate the state of a process, in a way that minimizes the mean of the squared error. The filter is very powerful in several aspects: it supports estimations of past, present, and even future states, and it can do so even when the precise nature of the modeled system is unknown. The purpose of this paper is to provide a practical introduction to the discrete Kalman filter. This introduction includes a description and some discussion of the basic discrete Kalman filter, a derivation, description and some discussion of the extended Kalman filter, and a relatively simple (tangible) example with real numbers \& results.},

The transformed data is still in the same time domain as the original data, and can therefore be directly used by any other mining algorithms. We also present a classification algorithm MinCov in this paper. Given a new data tuple, it provides values for each class that measures the likelihood of the tuple belonging to that class. The experimental results show that the MinCov algorithm is comparable to C4.5, and using MinCov as a mining algorithm the average hit rate of predicting the sign of stock return is 23.92\% higher than that on the original data. This means that the predicting accuracy has been remarkably improved by means of the proposed data reduction and noise filtering method.},

Time series data have been analyzed in either the time or frequency domains. The objective of this study is to propose a forecasting method based on wavelet filtering. The proposed method decomposes the original time series into the trend and variation parts and constructs a separate model for each part. Simulation and real case studies were conducted to examine the properties of the proposed method under various scenarios and compare its performance with time series forecasting models without wavelet filtering. The results from both simulated and real data showed that the proposed method based on wavelet filtering yielded more accurate results than the models without wavelet filtering in terms of mean absolute percentage error criterion.

This paper surveys the characteristics of several major methods (Delphi, Nominal Group, and models developed by the National Institutes of Health and Glaser) and provides guidelines for those who want to use the techniques. Among the concerns these guidelines address are selecting problems, choosing members for consensus panels, specifying acceptable levels of agreement, properly using empirical data, obtaining professional and political support, and disseminating results.},

abstract = {Numerical weather prediction models as well as the atmosphere itself can be viewed as nonlinear dynamical systems in which the evolution depends sensitively on the initial conditions. The fact that estimates of the current state are inaccurate and that numerical models have inadequacies, leads to forecast errors that grow with increasing forecast lead time. The growth of errors depends on the flow itself. Ensemble forecasting aims at quantifying this flow-dependent forecast uncertainty. The sources of uncertainty in weather forecasting are discussed. Then, an overview is given on evaluating probabilistic forecasts and their usefulness compared with single forecasts. Thereafter, the representation of uncertainties in ensemble forecasts is reviewed with an emphasis on the initial condition perturbations. The review is complemented by a detailed description of the methodology to generate initial condition perturbations of the Ensemble Prediction System (EPS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). These perturbations are based on the leading part of the singular value decomposition of the operator describing the linearised dynamics over a finite time interval. The perturbations are flow-dependent as the linearisation is performed with respect to a solution of the nonlinear forecast model. The extent to which the current ECMWF ensemble prediction system is capable of predicting flow-dependent variations in uncertainty is assessed for the large-scale flow in mid-latitudes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ability to accurately forecast census counts in hospital departments has considerable implications for hospital resource allocation. In recent years several different methods have been proposed forecasting census counts, however many of these approaches do not use available patient-specific information.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: In this paper we present an ensemble-based methodology for forecasting the census under a framework that simultaneously incorporates both (i) arrival trends over time and (ii) patient-specific baseline and time-varying information. The proposed model for predicting census has three components, namely: current census count, number of daily arrivals and number of daily departures. To model the number of daily arrivals, we use a seasonality adjusted Poisson Autoregressive (PAR) model where the parameter estimates are obtained via conditional maximum likelihood. The number of daily departures is predicted by modeling the probability of departure from the census using logistic regression models that are adjusted for the amount of time spent in the census and incorporate both patient-specific baseline and time varying patient-specific covariate information. We illustrate our approach using neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) data collected at Women {\&} Infants Hospital, Providence RI, which consists of 1001 consecutive NICU admissions between April 1st 2008 and March 31st 2009.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Our results demonstrate statistically significant improved prediction accuracy for 3, 5, and 7 day census forecasts and increased precision of our forecasting model compared to a forecasting approach that ignores patient-specific information.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Forecasting models that utilize patient-specific baseline and time-varying information make the most of data typically available and have the capacity to substantially improve census forecasts.},

Despite the obvious presence of uncertainty in measurements and in assumed model types/structures, most of the existing water consumption prediction models are developed and used in a deterministic context. Methods for more realistic assessment of parameter and model prediction uncertainties have begun to appear in literature only recently. A novel application of the Shuffled Complex Evolution Metropolis algorithm (SCEM-UA) for the calibration of a water consumption prediction model is proposed here. The model is applied to a case study of the city of Catania (Italy) with the aim to predict daily water consumption.

With the global installed wind power capacity rapidly increasing, wind industry is growing into a large-scale business. Reliable short-term wind speed forecasts play a practical and crucial role in wind energy conversion systems, such as the dynamic control of wind turbines and power system scheduling. In this paper, an intelligent hybrid model for short-term wind speed prediction is examined; the model is based on cross correlation (CC) analysis and a support vector regression (SVR) model that is coupled with brainstorm optimization (BSO) and cuckoo search (CS) algorithms, which are successfully utilized for parameter determination. The proposed hybrid models were used to forecast short-term wind speeds collected from four wind turbines located on a wind farm in China. The forecasting results demonstrate that the intelligent hybrid models outperform single models for short-term wind speed forecasting, which mainly results from the superiority of BSO and CS for parameter optimization.},

@article{Kourentzes2013,
abstract = {Intermittent demand appears when demand events occur only sporadically. Typically such time series have few observations making intermittent demand forecasting challenging. Forecast errors can be costly in terms of unmet demand or obsolescent stock. Intermittent demand forecasting has been addressed using established forecasting methods, including simple moving averages, exponential smoothing and Croston's method with its variants. This study proposes a neural network (NN) methodology to forecast intermittent time series. These NNs are used to provide dynamic demand rate forecasts, which do not assume constant demand rate in the future and can capture interactions between the non-zero demand and the inter-arrival rate of demand events. This overcomes the limitations of Croston's method. In order to mitigate the issue of limited fitting sample, which is common in intermittent demand, the proposed models use regularised training and median ensembles over multiple training initialisations to produce robust forecasts. The NNs are evaluated against established benchmarks using both forecasting accuracy and inventory metrics. The findings of forecasting and inventory metrics are conflicting. While NNs achieved poor forecasting accuracy and bias, all NN variants achieved higher service levels than the best performing Croston's method variant, without requiring analogous increases in stock holding volume. Therefore, NNs are found to be effective for intermittent demand applications. This study provides further arguments and evidence against the use of conventional forecasting accuracy metrics to evaluate forecasting methods for intermittent demand, concluding that attention to inventory metrics is desirable. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Grinstead2010,
abstract = {Most of our study of probability has dealt with independent trials processes. These processes are the basis of classical probability theory and much of statistics. We have discussed two of the principal theorems for these processes: the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem. We have seen that when a sequence of chance experiments forms an indepen- dent trials process, the possible outcomes for each experiment are the same and occur with the same probability. Further, knowledge of the outcomes of the pre- vious experiments does not influence our predictions for the outcomes of the next experiment. The distribution for the outcomes of a single experiment is sufficient to construct a tree and a tree measure for a sequence of n experiments, and we can answer any probability question about these experiments by using this tree measure. Modern probability theory studies chance processes for which the knowledge of previous outcomes influences predictions for future experiments. In principle, when we observe a sequence of chance experiments, all of the past outcomes could influence our predictions for the next experiment. For example, this should be the case in predicting a student’s grades on a sequence of exams in a course. But to allow this much generality would make it very difficult to prove general results. In 1907, A. A. Markov began the study of an important new type of chance process. In this process, the outcome of a given experiment can affect the outcome of the next experiment. This type of process is called a Markov chain.},

abstract = {Many statistical models, and in particular autoregressive-moving average time series models, can be regarded as means of transforming the data to white noise, that is, to an uncorrelated sequence of errors. If the parameters are known exactly, this random sequence can be computed directly from the observations; when this calculation is made with estimates substituted for the true parameter values, the resulting sequence is referred to as the "residuals," which can be regarded as esti- mates of the errors. If the appropriate model has been chosen, there will be zero autocorrelation in the errors. In checking adequacy of fit it is therefore logical to study the sample autocorrelation function of the residuals. For large samples the residuals from a correctly fitted model resemble very closely the true errors of the process; however, care is needed in interpreting the serial correlations of the residuals. It is shown here that the residual autocorrelations are to a close approximat.ion representable as a singular linear transformation of the autocorrelations of the errors so that they possess a singular normal distribution. Failing to allow for this results in a tendency to overlook evidence of lack of fit. Tests of fit and diagnostic checks are devised which take these facts into account.},

@article{SCM02,
abstract = {We introduce a novel multiple classifier system that incorporates a global optimization technique based on a genetic algorithm for configuring the system. The system adopts the weighted majority vote approach to combine the decision of the experts, and obtains the weights by maximizing the performance of the whole set of experts, rather than that of each of them separately. The system has been tested on a handwritten digit recognition problem, and its performance compared with those exhibited by a system using the weights obtained during the training of each expert separately. The results of a set of experiments conducted on 30,000 digits extracted from the NIST database have shown that the proposed system exhibits better performance than those of the alternative one, and that such an improvement is due to a better estimate of the reliability of the participating classifiers.},

abstract = {We present an algorithm for improving the accuracy of algorithms for learning binary concepts. The improvement is achieved by combining a large number of hypotheses, each of which is generated by training the given learning algorithm on a different set of examples. Our algorithm is based on ideas presented by Schapire and represents an improvement over his results, The analysis of our algorithm provides general upper bounds on the resources required for learning in Valiants polynomial PAC learning framework, which are the best general upper bounds known today. We show that the number of hypotheses that are combined by our algorithm is the smallest number possible. Other outcomes of our analysis are results regarding the representational power of threshold circuits, the relation between learnability and compression, and a method for parallelizing PAC learning algorithms. We provide extensions of our algorithms to cases in which the concepts are not binary and to the case where the accuracy of the learning algorithm depends on the distribution of the instances.},

We are particularly interested in methods that are ``knowledge-free'' and work for a variety of features, leading us to investigate MLLR transforms, phone N-grams, prosodic sequences, and word N-gram features. Normalization methods studied include mean/variance normalization, TFLLR and TFLOG scaling, and a simple nonparametric approach: rank-normalization. We find that rank-normalization is uniformly competitive with other methods, and improves upon them in many cases.},

@inproceedings{ELW08,
abstract = {In the framework of the European HearCom project, promising signal enhancement algorithms were developed and evaluated for future use in hearing instruments. To assess the algorithms' performance, five of the algorithms were selected and implemented on a common real-time hardware/software platform. Four test centers in Belgium, The Netherlands, Germany, and Switzerland perceptually evaluated the algorithms. Listening tests were performed with large numbers of normal-hearing and hearing-impaired subjects. Three perceptual measures were used: speech reception threshold (SRT), listening effort scaling, and preference rating. Tests were carried out in two types of rooms. Speech was presented in multitalker babble arriving from one or three loudspeakers. In a pseudo-diffuse noise scenario, only one algorithm, the spatially preprocessed speech-distortion-weighted multi-channel Wiener filtering, provided a SRT improvement relative to the unprocessed condition. Despite the general lack of improvement in SRT, some algorithms were preferred over the unprocessed condition at all tested signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). These effects were found across different subject groups and test sites. The listening effort scores were less consistent over test sites. For the algorithms that did not affect speech intelligibility, a reduction in listening effort was observed at 0 dB SNR.},

abstract = {Time series clustering has been shown effective in providing useful information in various domains. There seems to be an increased interest in time series clustering as part of the effort in temporal data mining research. To provide an overview, this paper surveys and summarizes previous works that investigated the clustering of time series data in various application domains. The basics of time series clustering are presented, including general-purpose clustering algorithms commonly used in time series clustering studies, the criteria for evaluating the performance of the clustering results, and the measures to determine the similarity/dissimilarity between two time series being compared, either in the forms of raw data, extracted features, or some model parameters. The past researchs are organized into three groups depending upon whether they work directly with the raw data either in the time or frequency domain, indirectly with features extracted from the raw data, or indirectly with models built from the raw data. The uniqueness and limitation of previous research are discussed and several possible topics for future research are identified. Moreover, the areas that time series clustering have been applied to are also summarized, including the sources of data used. It is hoped that this review will serve as the steppingstone for those interested in advancing this area of research.},

@article{CLX11,
abstract = {Kernel methods, in particular support vector machines, have been further extended into a new class of methods, which could effectively solve nonlinear problems in chemistry by using simple linear transformation. In fact, the kernel function used in kernel methods might be regarded as a general protocol to deal with nonlinear data in chemistry. In this paper, the basic idea and modularity of kernel methods, together with some simple examples, are discussed in detail to give an in-depth understanding for kernel methods. Three key ingredients of kernel methods, namely dual form, nonlinear mapping and kernel function, provide a consistent framework of kernel-based algorithms. The modularity of kernel methods allows linear algorithms to combine with any kernel function. Thus, some commonly used chemometric algorithms are easily extended to their kernel versions. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

The wave function is a linear combination of product basis functions, and each product basis function in turn is formally equivalent to a linear combination of configuration state functions that comprise an underlying linear expansion space. The expansion coefficients that define the basis functions are nonlinear functions of a smaller number of variables. The expansion form is appropriate for both ground and excited states and to both closed and open shell molecules. The method is formulated in terms of spin-eigenfunctions using the graphical unitary group approach (GUGA), and consequently it does not suffer from spin contamination.},

abstract = {Discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs) is based on the theory of function approximation, with several key choices to be made: an integral equation formulation, or approximate solution operator; the type of discretization, defined by the function subspace in which the solution is approximated; the choice of grids, e.g. regular versus irregular grids to conform to the geometry, or static versus solution adaptive grids. We explore some of the common approaches to the choice of form of the PDE and the space-time discretization, leaving discussion of the grids for a later chapter. The goal is to introduce the reader to various forms of discretization and to illustrate the numerical performance of different methods. In particular, we will address how to choose a method that is accurate, robust and efficient for the problem at hand. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

Thus it is necessary to convert input data sets with continuous attributes into input data sets with discrete attributes. Methods of discretization restricted to single continuous attributes will be called local, while methods that simultaneously convert all continuous attributes will be called global. In this paper, a method of transforming any local discretization method into a global one is presented. A global discretization method, based on cluster analysis, is presented and compared experimentally with three known local methods, transformed into global.

abstract = {This empirical paper compares the accuracy of six univariate methods for short-term electricity demand forecasting for lead times up to a day ahead. The very short lead times are of particular interest as univariate methods are often replaced by multivariate methods for prediction beyond about six hours ahead. The methods considered include the recently proposed exponential smoothing method for double seasonality and a new method based on principal component analysis (PCA). The methods are compared using a time series of hourly demand for Rio de Janeiro and a series of half-hourly demand for England and Wales. The PCA method performed well, but, overall, the best results were achieved with the exponential smoothing method, leading us to conclude that simpler and more robust methods, which require little domain knowledge, can outperform more complex alternatives. ?? 2005 International Institute of Forecasters.
